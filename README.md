This project compares different sampling techniques when used up on various ML models for classification: following sampling techniques were used:

Random Sampling
Structured Sampling
Stratified sampling
cluster sampling
Weighted sampling
for the following ML models

logistic regression
Random forest classifier
Naive bayes
SVM
Decision Tree classifier
You can just run the file Main.py with the given dataset to find out which sampling is best for the following models PS: Oversampling using SMOTE was applied prior to applying these techniques.
